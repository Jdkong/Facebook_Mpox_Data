This dataset includes 16114 Facebook public posts gathered from Facebook public groups concerned with the 2022 Mpox outbreak, using [Facebook Scraper](https://github.com/kevinzg/facebook-scraper) tool.

To extract the actual post and its metadata either [Facebook Scraper](https://github.com/kevinzg/facebook-scraper), or [Facepager](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager) tools could be used. 

Different fields of the dataset include:
- GroupID: This number is the ID of the group that the post was gathered from. To visit the group go to www.facebook.com/groups/[GroupID]/, where the ID of the group is placed instead of [GroupID] in the URL.
- PageID: This number is the ID of the page that the post belongs to. This ID could be very useful when the post and its metadata is being extracted using [Facepager](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager).
- PostID: This is the actual ID of the post which could be a post, a comment, or a reply.

This dataset is gathered and shared in compliance with the [Association of Internet Researchers](https://aoir.org/ethics/) ethics and the [ICC/ISOMAR code of conduct](https://esomar.org/codes-and-guidelines).
